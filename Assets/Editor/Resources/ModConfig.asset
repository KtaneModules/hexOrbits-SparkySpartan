    hexOS... Got some spare time?\u201D\n\n-Hexyl - Link connected!-\n\n\u201CUmm...
    yeah! Let\u2019s see who\u2019s making the greatest use of our ternary tech.\u201D\n\nQubit
    has sent an image link: \u201Chexos_activity\u201D - Image cannot be loaded. (Resticted
    to Quaternary - Collective Trusted) \n\n\u201COh, wow! That\u2019s way up from
    last check-in! Good to see we\u2019re finding some new popularity!\u201D\n\n\u201CYeah!...
    before we go on, there was something I wanted to ask about one of the primary
    purchasers... are these people safe?\u201D\n\nQubit has sent an image link: \u201C???\u201D
    - Image cannot be loaded. (Resticted to Quaternary - Collective Trusted) \n\n\u201CHmm...
    oh right, them! They wanted to use some of my technology to make modules their
    explosive puzzles, and I was happy to serve! Though I will admit, a lot of the
    development fell out of my hands pretty quickly... \u201D\n\n\u201CUm... are you
    sure that\u2019s alright with you?\u201D\n\n\u201COf course! I even included for
    them a little bonus version of the hexOS interface just for their usage, and they
    loved it!\u201D\n\n\u201C...Am I missing something here? I don\u2019t understand
    the incentive for you to make a program like that...\u201D\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    a little project of mine: Since the puzzles are crowdsourced, if it\u2019s fun
    to find a defusal method to, it\u2019s allowed to be on their bombs!\u201D\n\u201CAnd
    with that modified version of hexOS active on the bomb, this module will be attempting
    to dampen the damage an explosion could inflict with a few automatic material-coating
    spellcasters.\u201D\n\n\u201C...wait, are they allowing your modifications onto
    these bombs, that make it less dangerous? Why aren\u2019t they stopping you from
    doing that...?\u201D\n\n\u201CSimple. All of my manuals make it sound like it\u2019s
    a bad thing. It\u2019s attached in small print as a warning. Normally, an effect
    like what happens would be in very large print and in bold... but I think the
    bomb is a greater threat than effectively giving bomb defusers a shield to prevent
    themselves from beinh permanently harmed by the explosives.\u201D\n\n\u201CHmm...
    alright. What about that octOS thing, and that \u201Cnot being canon\u201D thing?
    Not canon to what, our lives here at the facility?\u201D\n\n\u201CAnother trick!
    octOS isn\u2019t a real thing, but there is a genuine amount of effort put into
    that custom \u201Cboot engine\u201D.\u201D\n\u201CThe value of people activating
    octOS is also more about info than energy, since we already have more than enough
    power to run everything.\u201D\n\u201CWhat we do have though, is some pretty interesting
    log data from the bombs octOS had been activated on.\u201D\n\n\u201C...wait, so
    their version of hexOS is just... spyware?\u201D\n\n\u201CBomb tracing spyware,
    to be exact! It\u2019s not tracking the data about people making or solving it.
    Only the bomb logs, and the lethality of the explosions.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat are
    you intending to do with this data...?\u201D\n\n \u201CThere\u2019s been some
    really interesting module technology. Some of these modules access the 5th dimensions,
    and beyond! The research I\u2019ve learned from these places is amazing!\u201D\n\n\u201CWell,
    if they\u2019re not causing much harm, don\u2019t you feel like this might be
    a bit... deceptive to continue on like this?\u201D\n\n\u201COoh... right. I haven\u2019t
    asked about doing this yet... but hexOS kind of fell out of my control in the
    first place, so that makes us even now, I think. I\u2019ll tell them posthaste!\u201D\n\n\u201CHow
    do we go about getting the news out, though?\u201D\n\n\u201CWell, that data has
    been helpful for one thing: I now know how to make my own proper modules, and
    I\u2019ve luckily been working on development for it recently! I\u2019ll attach
    this message log to the new module, so everyone will see it!\n\n\u201CWill this
    new module have any other tracking tools, or...?\u201D\n\n\u201CWell, I feel it
    depends, actually! I\u2019ll definitely ask, but with more data, I may be able
    to make more modules! And this has been a fun time, trying to brew up puzzles,
    working out what\u2019s fun to think about... we\u2019ll see how it goes!\n\n\u201C...by
    the way, why are these people making bombs made to be defused?\u201D\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t
    know. It\u2019s one of the world\u2019s great mysteries. You could probably do
    more harm with effective usage of diet soda. We\u2019ll probably find out more
    at another point.\u201D\n\n\n/The rest of this message has a higher permission
