-Qubit - Sent Invite Link-

“Hey, I have a report of the most frequent usage of hexOS... Got some spare time?”

-Hexyl - Link connected!-

“Umm... yeah! Let’s see who’s making the greatest use of our ternary tech.”

Qubit has sent an image link: “hexos_activity” - Image cannot be loaded. (Resticted to Quaternary - Collective Trusted) 

“Oh, wow! That’s way up from last check-in! Good to see we’re finding some new popularity!”

“Yeah!... before we go on, there was something I wanted to ask about one of the primary purchasers... are these people safe?”

Qubit has sent an image link: “???” - Image cannot be loaded. (Resticted to Quaternary - Collective Trusted) 

“Hmm... oh right, them! They wanted to use some of my technology to make modules their explosive puzzles, and I was happy to serve! Though I will admit, a lot of the development fell out of my hands pretty quickly... ”

“Um... are you sure that’s alright with you?”

“Of course! I even included for them a little bonus version of the hexOS interface just for their usage, and they loved it!”

“...Am I missing something here? I don’t understand the incentive for you to make a program like that...”

“It’s a little project of mine: Since the puzzles are crowdsourced, if it’s fun to find a defusal method to, it’s allowed to be on their bombs!”
“And with that modified version of hexOS active on the bomb, this module will be attempting to dampen the damage an explosion could inflict with a few automatic material-coating spellcasters.”

“...wait, are they allowing your modifications onto these bombs, that make it less dangerous? Why aren’t they stopping you from doing that...?”

“Simple. All of my manuals make it sound like it’s a bad thing. It’s attached in small print as a warning. Normally, an effect like what happens would be in very large print and in bold... but I think the bomb is a greater threat than effectively giving bomb defusers a shield to prevent themselves from beinh permanently harmed by the explosives.”

“Hmm... alright. What about that octOS thing, and that “not being canon” thing? Not canon to what, our lives here at the facility?”

“Another trick! octOS isn’t a real thing, but there is a genuine amount of effort put into that custom “boot engine”.”
“The value of people activating octOS is also more about info than energy, since we already have more than enough power to run everything.”
“What we do have though, is some pretty interesting log data from the bombs octOS had been activated on.”

“...wait, so their version of hexOS is just... spyware?”

“Bomb tracing spyware, to be exact! It’s not tracking the data about people making or solving it. Only the bomb logs, and the lethality of the explosions.”

“What are you intending to do with this data...?”

 “There’s been some really interesting module technology. Some of these modules access the 5th dimensions, and beyond! The research I’ve learned from these places is amazing!”

“Well, if they’re not causing much harm, don’t you feel like this might be a bit... deceptive to continue on like this?”

“Ooh... right. I haven’t asked about doing this yet... but hexOS kind of fell out of my control in the first place, so that makes us even now, I think. I’ll tell them posthaste!”

“How do we go about getting the news out, though?”

“Well, that data has been helpful for one thing: I now know how to make my own proper modules, and I’ve luckily been working on development for it recently! I’ll attach this message log to the new module, so everyone will see it!

“Will this new module have any other tracking tools, or...?”

“Well, I feel it depends, actually! I’ll definitely ask, but with more data, I may be able to make more modules! And this has been a fun time, trying to brew up puzzles, working out what’s fun to think about... we’ll see how it goes!

“...by the way, why are these people making bombs made to be defused?”

“Don’t know. It’s one of the world’s great mysteries. You could probably do more harm with effective usage of diet soda. We’ll probably find out more at another point.”
